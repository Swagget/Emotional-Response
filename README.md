This is a deep learning model that analyses photos to determine the emotional response of a human seeing the photo

# Data
This uses images of artwork, with 8 basic human emotions: anger, fear, sadness, disgust, surprise, anxiety, trust and joy.
This uses images that create these feelings in humans to train a Convolutional neural network to predict the emotions humans would feel on viewing a piece of art or a photograph.
